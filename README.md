# TrafficSimulator

# Creators
* Schidu Luca - Core of the application, simulation
* Schidu Vasile - UI (haven't done yet)

# Tasks performed
* Simulate the work of an intersection with 4 traffic lights.
* User can increase the number of generated cars with mouse wheel
* 2 crosswalks
* Generates special cars (police - marked with red color) It can cross the street even on red traffic light. Other cars will wait for it
* Rules are respected.
* Car accident can happen, although they just move into each other, traffic won't stop because of them


# UI
* Unfortunatelly the other member didn't managed to perform the task(because of lack of time). So the graphics are not so good.
* Circles are traffic lights.
* Rectangles are cars.
* Squares are pedestrians.
* Streets are drawn with some lines.

# Git
I've create a git repository on my profile. I created a branch named controller and worked on it. After all the work was done , I merged it with the master branch.
